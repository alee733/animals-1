Pandas are large, black and white bears native to China. They are known for their distinctive black and white fur and their love of bamboo. 
Pandas are solitary animals and spend most of their day eating bamboo. They are also excellent climbers and swimmers. Pandas are considered 
endangered due to habitat loss and the illegal pet trade.
