Cats are known for their independent and curious nature. They are excellent hunters and are often seen stalking prey. Cats are also very clean animals and spend a significant amount of time grooming themselves. They come in a wide variety of breeds, each with its own unique characteristics. Some cats are playful and energetic, while others are more laid-back and relaxed.
